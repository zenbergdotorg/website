# INVEST

Our first day! The talented Sonia Horn joins us and helps us distribute our famous **["Salted Butter Popcorn"]**

--

**zenberg:** Hi :) How are you?

**potential investor:** I'm very well, how are you?

**zenberg:** A bit broke because its January!

**potential investor:** Ah that sucks.

--

**zenberg:** How about we make a deal?

**potential investor:** Im listening...

**zenberg:** We raise money to help the homeless get off the MuiZENBERG streets before winter 2022.

**Eddard Stark:** "WINTER IS COMING"

**potential investor:** Ok im listening...

**zenberg:** So we run a radio station as well.  How about if you make a small investment we will make you a DJ on our radio station.  As long as you have internet you can DJ :)

**potential investor:** Ok how much do you want?

**zenberg:** +- R50 or R100.  That buys popcorn, boerewors, eggs, rolls etc that we sell to support ourselves and the small community around it

**potential investor:** Is this not a donation then?

**zenberg:** No heres the cool part!  You double your money!  

**zenberg:** We pay you back double (or equivalent in products we sell), its better than any bank :)  Usually within the time frame of one to two weeks.  

**potential investor:** Ahh thats awesome.  How do I do it?

--

**zenberg:** Think of a username (DJ name) and a password and email us dj@zenberg.org.  We will set up your DJ account and then you are welcome to make a small investment into our capitec account.  We will thank you publically on the website and email you updates of exactly where you money went and who it is helping get of the street.

**potential investor:** Lekker, ill do it
