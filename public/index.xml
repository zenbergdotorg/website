      <description>Jamie Replicating Piet Mondrian&amp;rsquo;s art with code is no easy task, in fact honestly I&amp;rsquo;d say there&amp;rsquo;s no real way of pinning down his creations entirely with code, they were hand made. That said, we can try to replicate something within the realm of what would have been one of Piet&amp;rsquo;s works&amp;hellip; so that&amp;rsquo;s what we will do in this tutorial&amp;hellip; and yes, we will add the color as well.</description>
